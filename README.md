## About V3O.JS

V3O.JS aims to provide a set of tools allowing for viewing and editing V3O Model Files (Emergency 3, Emergency 4, 911 First Responders, etc.) directly on the web. Currently, achieving this goal requires the use of external tools, with the Blender Scripts by MedicalByte being the most prominent among them.

## Usage

To use the V3O.JS, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `*.html` file of the desired tool.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.
